-- Test Dashboard Access with RLS Policies
-- Run this to verify your A-Player Evaluation Dashboard will work correctly

-- =============================================================================
-- STEP 1: Check Data Availability (Simulating Dashboard Queries)
-- =============================================================================

-- Test 1: Check if employees are accessible (Employee Selection Page)
SELECT 'EMPLOYEE SELECTION TEST' as test_section;
SELECT 
    COUNT(*) as total_active_employees,
    COUNT(DISTINCT department) as departments,
    MIN(hire_date) as earliest_hire,
    MAX(hire_date) as latest_hire
FROM people 
WHERE active = true;

-- Test 2: Check if quarters are accessible (Quarter Selection)
SELECT 'QUARTER SELECTION TEST' as test_section;
SELECT 
    COUNT(*) as total_quarters,
    MIN(start_date) as earliest_quarter,
    MAX(end_date) as latest_quarter
FROM evaluation_cycles
ORDER BY start_date;

-- Test 3: Check evaluation data accessibility (Main Charts)
SELECT 'EVALUATION DATA TEST' as test_section;
SELECT 
    COUNT(*) as total_evaluation_records,
    COUNT(DISTINCT evaluatee_id) as employees_with_data,
    COUNT(DISTINCT quarter_id) as quarters_with_data
FROM weighted_evaluation_scores;

-- Test 4: Check submission data (Detailed Analysis)
SELECT 'SUBMISSION DATA TEST' as test_section;
SELECT 
    COUNT(*) as total_submissions,
    COUNT(DISTINCT evaluatee_id) as employees_with_submissions,
    COUNT(DISTINCT quarter_id) as quarters_with_submissions
FROM submissions;

-- Test 5: Check attribute scores (Your 70 records!)
SELECT 'ATTRIBUTE SCORES TEST' as test_section;
SELECT 
    COUNT(*) as total_attribute_scores,
    COUNT(DISTINCT submission_id) as unique_submissions,
    COUNT(DISTINCT attribute_name) as unique_attributes
FROM attribute_scores;

-- Test 6: Check analysis jobs status
SELECT 'ANALYSIS JOBS TEST' as test_section;
SELECT 
    COUNT(*) as total_analysis_jobs,
    COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE status = 'completed') as completed_jobs,
    COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE status = 'pending') as pending_jobs,
    COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE status = 'processing') as processing_jobs,
    COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE status = 'error') as error_jobs
FROM analysis_jobs;

-- Test 7: Check app configuration
SELECT 'APP CONFIG TEST' as test_section;
SELECT 
    COUNT(*) as total_config_items,
    COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE key LIKE '%webhook%') as webhook_configs,
    COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE key LIKE '%url%') as url_configs
FROM app_config;

-- =============================================================================
-- STEP 2: Sample Data Preview (What Dashboard Will Show)
-- =============================================================================

-- Preview: Sample employees for selection
SELECT 'SAMPLE EMPLOYEES PREVIEW' as preview_section;
SELECT 
    name,
    department,
    role,
    hire_date
FROM people 
WHERE active = true
ORDER BY name
LIMIT 5;

-- Preview: Sample quarters for selection  
SELECT 'SAMPLE QUARTERS PREVIEW' as preview_section;
SELECT 
    name as quarter_name,
    start_date,
    end_date,
    DATE_PART('year', start_date) as year
FROM evaluation_cycles
ORDER BY start_date DESC
LIMIT 5;

-- Preview: Sample evaluation data
SELECT 'SAMPLE EVALUATION DATA PREVIEW' as preview_section;
SELECT 
    evaluatee_name,
    quarter_name,
    attribute_name,
    weighted_final_score,
    completion_percentage
FROM weighted_evaluation_scores
ORDER BY evaluatee_name, quarter_name, attribute_name
LIMIT 10;

-- =============================================================================
-- STEP 3: RLS Policy Verification  
-- =============================================================================

-- Show all active policies
SELECT 'ACTIVE RLS POLICIES SUMMARY' as verification_section;
SELECT 
    tablename,
    COUNT(*) as policy_count,
    string_agg(DISTINCT cmd, ', ') as allowed_operations
FROM pg_policies 
WHERE schemaname = 'public'
GROUP BY tablename
ORDER BY tablename;

-- STEP 4: Dashboard Readiness Check
