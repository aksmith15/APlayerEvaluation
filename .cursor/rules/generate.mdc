   - Environment setup with established tech stack
   - Project structure following 3-page architecture
   - Database integration with existing schema
2. **Stage 2: Core Dashboard Pages**
   - Login page
   - Employee selection page
   - Employee analytics display page
3. **Stage 3: Data Visualization Features**
   - Charts and analytics displays
   - AI analysis results display
   - Performance metrics visualization
4. **Stage 4: Polish & Optimization**
   - Performance optimization
   - UI/UX enhancements
   - Testing and deployment

### Step 5: Detailed Implementation Plan Creation
For each stage, create:
- **Broad sub-steps** referencing existing code patterns
- **Checkboxes for each task** using `- [ ]` markdown format
- **Estimated time/effort indicators**
- **Dependencies between tasks**
- **Integration with existing database schema and API patterns**

- Implement webhook integration for individual meta-analysis by fetching URL from app_config table (key: "n8n_webhook_url")
- Create service functions to retrieve configuration values from app_config table

### Maintain Consistency
- All generated documentation should align with the dashboard focus from the PRD
- Code examples should use quarter-filtered data fetching and display patterns only
- Integration patterns should follow data visualization requirements with quarter filtering
- Error handling should match patterns for quarter-filtered data display failures
- Webhook integration should follow the established n8n workflow patterns
- PDF viewer and download functionality should align with the bottom-of-page layout requirements

## Response Style
- Be specific to the A-Player Evaluations dashboard requirements with quarter filtering capabilities
- Reference the existing architecture and patterns for quarter-filtered data visualization
- Provide actionable tasks that build upon established foundations for dashboard development
- Ensure all documentation is consistent with the dashboard-focused PRD document
- Focus on practical implementation steps for the 3-page data visualization dashboard

- Consider download functionality for both AI analysis and full analytics view

Remember: Your goal is to create a practical, implementable plan for a quarter-filtered data visualization dashboard that displays existing A-Player Evaluations data. All documentation should be consistent with the dashboard-focused PRD document and support the development of a professional employee evaluation data visualization system with comprehensive quarter filtering and AI analysis capabilities.
