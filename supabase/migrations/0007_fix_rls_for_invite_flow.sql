-- Migration: Fix RLS policies to allow invite flow provisioning
-- The current policies are too restrictive for service role operations during invite acceptance
-- Date: February 1, 2025

-- Add service role policies for invite provisioning
-- These allow edge functions to create/update records during invite acceptance

-- 1. Profiles: Allow service role to insert/update during provisioning
CREATE POLICY "profiles_service_role_provisioning" ON public.profiles
  FOR ALL
  USING (auth.role() = 'service_role')
  WITH CHECK (auth.role() = 'service_role');

-- 2. People: Allow service role to insert/update during provisioning  
CREATE POLICY "people_service_role_provisioning" ON public.people
  FOR ALL
  USING (auth.role() = 'service_role')
  WITH CHECK (auth.role() = 'service_role');

-- 3. Company memberships: Allow service role to insert/update during provisioning
CREATE POLICY "company_memberships_service_role_provisioning" ON public.company_memberships
  FOR ALL
  USING (auth.role() = 'service_role')
  WITH CHECK (auth.role() = 'service_role');

-- 4. Invites: Allow service role to select/update during provisioning
CREATE POLICY "invites_service_role_access" ON public.invites
  FOR ALL
  USING (auth.role() = 'service_role')
  WITH CHECK (auth.role() = 'service_role');

-- 5. Companies: Allow service role to read company data during provisioning
CREATE POLICY "companies_service_role_read" ON public.companies
  FOR SELECT
  USING (auth.role() = 'service_role');
