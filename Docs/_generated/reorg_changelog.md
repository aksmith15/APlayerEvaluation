# Documentation Reorganization Changelog

**Date**: 2025-08-18  
**Phase**: A - Planning Phase  
**Status**: Plan Generated ✅  

## Summary

This reorganization consolidates all documentation into a structured `docs/` hierarchy, improving discoverability and maintainability. The reorganization follows documentation best practices with clear separation between explanation, how-to guides, reference material, and operational runbooks.

## Directory Structure Created

```

- `Docs/CONTEXT.md` → `docs/_generated/`
- `Docs/audit.config.json` → `docs/_generated/` (active config)

#### Archived Documentation (15+ files)
All historical, superseded, or completed implementation docs moved to `docs/_archive/` with date stamps.

### 🗄️ SQL Maintenance Files (3 files moved)
- `create_profiles_for_existing_auth.sql` → `supabase/sql/maintenance/`
- `populate_profiles_table.sql` → `supabase/sql/maintenance/`
- `debug_auth_users.sql` → `supabase/sql/maintenance/`

### 📋 Special Handling

#### Appended Content
- `a-player-dashboard/RLS-IMPLEMENTATION-GUIDE.md` content appended to `docs/reference/db/rls-policies.md`

#### Kept in Place (with links)
- `a-player-dashboard/database-schema.sql` (linked from docs)
- `a-player-dashboard/schema_dump.sql` (linked from docs)
- `Docs/db/schema.sql` → kept with migrations, linked from overview

## Files Affected

### Total File Count
- **Moved**: 40+ files
- **Merged**: 7 source files → 3 target files  
- **Archived**: 15+ files with date stamps
- **SQL relocated**: 3 maintenance scripts
- **Created**: 2 new navigation files

### Directories
- **Created**: 10 new documentation directories
- **Preserved**: `Docs/_ARCHIVE/` structure maintained
- **Untouched**: All application code directories

## Link Updates Required

After the move operations, all relative Markdown links within `docs/**` will need to be updated to reflect the new file locations. This includes:

- Internal documentation cross-references
- Image and diagram links
- Links to schema and database files

## Quality Assurance

### Pre-Move Validation
- ✅ All source files exist and are readable
- ✅ Target directory structure created
- ✅ No conflicts with existing docs/ structure
- ✅ SQL maintenance directory created
- ✅ Safety guards implemented

### Execution Safety Measures
- **Missing Source Guard**: Skip mappings for non-existent files with logging
- **Case Normalization**: Handle Docs/ → docs/ safely on Windows/macOS
- **Link-Only Enforcement**: Schema files stay in place, only links added
- **Directory Creation**: Auto-create missing destination directories
- **Cross-Links**: Add rationale links from ARCHITECTURE.md to explanation docs

### Post-Move Validation (Phase B)
- [ ] All files moved successfully
- [ ] No broken relative links in docs/**
- [ ] Merged files contain proper provenance comments
- [ ] Archive files include date stamps
- [ ] Application code untouched
- [ ] Schema files remain in original locations
- [ ] Routes table includes all 9 routes with DEV marking

## Rollback Plan

All operations use `git mv` commands which are reversible. Merged files include source provenance comments to enable reconstruction if needed.

## Next Steps

1. **Phase B Execution** (pending user approval):
   - Execute all `git mv` operations
   - Create merged files with provenance
   - Create new navigation files (README.md, routes.md)
   - Update relative links
   - Generate link check report
   - Remove empty Docs/ directory

2. **Verification**:
   - Confirm 0 broken links in docs/**
   - Validate merged content accuracy  
   - Test application functionality unchanged
   - Verify schema links work correctly
   - Check cross-links from architecture to explanation docs
   - Validate routes table completeness (9 routes)

*This changelog will be updated during Phase B execution with actual results and any adjustments made during implementation.*
