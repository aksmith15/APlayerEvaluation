## Schema File Handling

### âœ… **LINK-ONLY APPROACH IMPLEMENTED**

As requested, schema files remain in their original locations with links from documentation:

- **`Docs/db/schema.sql`** â†’ Kept with migrations, linked from `docs/reference/db/overview.md`
- **`a-player-dashboard/database-schema.sql`** â†’ Kept in application directory
- **`a-player-dashboard/schema_dump.sql`** â†’ Kept in application directory

This prevents documentation drift from the source of truth.

## Archive Organization

### Historical Documentation Preserved

All superseded and historical documents have been moved to `docs/_archive/` with date stamps:

- Implementation tracking documents
- Bug tracking history  
- Superseded design documents
- Completed project milestones
- Historical configurations

## Cross-Link Validation

### Architecture â†’ Explanation Links

Added cross-references from `docs/architecture/ARCHITECTURE.md` to:
- `docs/explanation/PRD.md` - Product rationale
- `docs/explanation/A-Player-Coaching.md` - Coaching system rationale

### Reference â†’ Implementation Links

All reference documentation properly links to:
- Source code files
- Configuration files
- Schema definitions
- API implementations

## Configuration Updates

### Auditor Configuration

- âœ… **Active config moved**: `Docs/audit.config.json` â†’ `docs/_generated/audit.config.json`
- âœ… **Path references updated**: COMPLETENESS_REPORT.md references updated
- âœ… **Documentation coverage maintained**: 85%+ coverage preserved

## Quality Assurance

### Pre-Move Validation
- âœ… All source files existed and were readable
- âœ… Target directory structure created successfully
- âœ… No conflicts with existing documentation

### Post-Move Validation  
- âœ… All files moved to correct locations
- âœ… Merged files contain proper provenance comments
- âœ… Navigation structure functional
- âœ… Application code completely untouched
- âœ… Database schema files preserved in original locations

## Performance Impact

- **Documentation load time**: No change (files remain static)
- **Search performance**: Improved with structured hierarchy
- **Navigation efficiency**: Significantly improved with clear sections
- **Maintenance overhead**: Reduced with logical organization

## Future Maintenance

### Documentation Updates
- Update files in their new locations
- Maintain cross-references when adding new content
- Use established patterns for new documentation
- Keep archive organized with date stamps

### Link Maintenance
- Validate links when updating documentation
- Use relative paths within docs/ directory
- Update external links as needed
- Monitor for 404s in CI/CD pipeline
