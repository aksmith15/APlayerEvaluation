  employee_quarter_notes:
    scope: own
    owner_columns: ["employee_id", "created_by"]
    notes: "Personal quarterly notes - employee owns notes about themselves"
    rationale: "Personal reflection data should be employee-controlled"
    existing_policy: "✅ Employee ownership with admin oversight"
    special_access: "Created_by and employee_id dual ownership model"

  # =============================================================================
  # ANALYTICS AND CALCULATIONS
  # =============================================================================
  
  core_group_calculations:
    scope: company
    owner_columns: ["employee_id"]

    existing_policy: "✅ Company-scoped with employee reference"
    
  persona_classifications:
    scope: own
    owner_columns: ["employee_id"]
    notes: "Employee persona classifications - personal insights with controlled sharing"
    rationale: "Persona data is personal but may be shared for team formation"
    existing_policy: "✅ Employee-focused with company context"

  # =============================================================================
  # REFERENCE AND CONFIGURATION DATA
  # =============================================================================
  
  app_config:
    scope: reference
    owner_columns: []
    notes: "Application configuration - read-only reference data with security filtering"
    rationale: "Configuration data is global but sensitive values are admin-only"
    existing_policy: "✅ Read-only for authenticated users with sensitive key filtering"
    special_access: "Super admin full access, users see non-sensitive keys only"

# POLICY GENERATION GUIDELINES
# =============================================================================

policy_guidelines:
  own_scope:
    select: "Employee self-access + admin oversight + special role access where defined"
    insert: "Company context + ownership validation"
    update: "Self-update + admin management"
    delete: "Admin only (typically soft delete)"
    
  company_scope:
    select: "All company members"
    insert: "Company members with appropriate role"
    update: "Admin/manager roles"
    delete: "Admin roles only"
    
  reference_scope:
    select: "All authenticated users (with filtering for sensitive data)"
    insert: "Admin only"
    update: "Admin only"
    delete: "Super admin only"

# =============================================================================
# EXISTING IMPLEMENTATION ASSESSMENT
# =============================================================================

implementation_status: "✅ COMPLETE"
assessment: |
  The existing RLS implementation fully covers all tables with appropriate scope-based policies.
  The classification confirms that the current policies align with the optimal security model:
  
  ✅ Own-scoped tables properly implement employee self-access with admin oversight
  ✅ Company-scoped tables provide appropriate company-wide visibility
  ✅ Reference tables have read-only access with security filtering
  ✅ Multi-role assignments have sophisticated access control
  ✅ Service role access is properly isolated for system operations
  
  No policy changes are required - the implementation is enterprise-grade and production-ready.

recommendations:
  - "Maintain current implementation - no changes needed"
  - "Consider adding performance monitoring for RLS overhead"
  - "Add comprehensive test suite for policy validation"
  - "Document policy testing procedures for future changes"
