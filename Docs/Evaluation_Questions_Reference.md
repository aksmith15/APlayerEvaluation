### **Survey Flow:**
1. **Base Questions** - Asked for every attribute regardless of score
2. **Scoring Phase** - 1-10 scale with detailed descriptions

- Score determines conditional question set
- All responses stored in `attribute_responses` table
- Calculated scores stored in `attribute_scores` table

### **Data Structure:**
```javascript
// Question Structure
{
  id: 'unique_question_identifier',
  attribute_name: 'Attribute Name',
  question_text: 'The actual question text',
  question_type: 'single_select' | 'multi_select' | 'text',
  is_required: boolean,
  options?: string[], // For select questions
  max_selections?: number, // For multi_select
  placeholder?: string, // For text questions
  order: number
}
```

## ‚ö†Ô∏è **Important Notes for Developers**

### **When Modifying Survey Questions:**
1. **Check this document first** for current question structure
2. **Update this document** when making changes to questions
3. **Test conditional logic** thoroughly - score ranges trigger different question sets
4. **Consider data migration** if changing question IDs or structure
5. **Verify scoring calculations** still work with question changes

### **Question ID Naming Convention:**
`{attribute_name}_{question_purpose}_{specific_aspect}`

Examples:
- `reliability_commitment_follow_through`
- `leadership_excellence_systems`
- `teamwork_struggle_situations`

### **Database Integration:**
- Questions stored as JSON in application code
- Responses stored in `attribute_responses` table
- Question IDs must remain consistent for historical data integrity
- Score calculations depend on question structure
