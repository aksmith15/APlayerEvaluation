## Project Overview

A-Player Evaluations is a data visualization dashboard for displaying quarterly employee evaluation data stored in Supabase. The dashboard provides managers with comprehensive views of 360-degree feedback through a 3-page interface: Login, Employee Selection, and Employee Analytics Display.

**Key Architecture Note:** ALL analytics and chart functionality is contained within the **Employee Analytics Display page**. This page opens when an employee is selected from the Employee Selection page and contains all data visualization, charts, AI analysis, and reporting features.

The system visualizes weighted evaluation scores calculated from Manager (55%), Peer (35%), and Self (10%) assessments across 10 standardized performance attributes. AI-powered analysis is performed externally via n8n workflows, with results displayed through integrated PDF viewers and download capabilities.

- **attribute_responses** (id, submission_id, attribute_name, question_id, question_text, response_type, response_value, score_context, attribute_score_id, created_at)

### 🆕 **Data Source Mapping for Charts (Updated January 16, 2025):**

## **Chart Data Sources - Current Implementation**

### **Radar Chart & Clustered Bar Chart**
- **Data Source:** `weighted_evaluation_scores` table
- **Fetching Function:** `fetchEvaluationScores(employeeId, quarterId)`
- **Key Columns:**
  - `manager_score` - Manager evaluation scores (1-10)
  - `peer_score` - Peer evaluation scores (1-10) 
  - `self_score` - Self evaluation scores (1-10)
  - `weighted_final_score` - Calculated weighted final score
- **Filtering:** Quarter-specific (user selects quarter in header)
- **User Controls:** Quarter selector dropdown (affects both charts simultaneously)
- **Data Relationship:** Both charts use identical data source with same quarter filter

### **Trend Line Chart** 
- **Data Source:** `quarter_final_scores` database view
- **Fetching Function:** `fetchQuarterlyTrendData(employeeId, quarterCount)`
- **Key Column:** `final_quarter_score` - Pre-aggregated quarterly performance score
- **Current Behavior:** Fetches last 4 quarters automatically from view
- **Data Relationship:** Independent of other charts' quarter selection

## **Database Views and Tables**

#### **quarter_final_scores** - Aggregated Quarter Performance Data
**Purpose:** Provides quarterly aggregated evaluation data per employee for trend analysis and historical comparisons

**Schema:**
| Field Name | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| evaluatee_id | UUID | Employee identifier |
| evaluatee_name | VARCHAR | Employee display name |
| quarter_id | UUID | Quarter identifier |
| quarter_name | VARCHAR | Quarter display name (e.g., "Q2 2025") |
| quarter_start_date | DATE | Quarter start date |
| quarter_end_date | DATE | Quarter end date |
| total_weighted_score | DECIMAL | Sum of all weighted scores for the quarter |
| total_weight | DECIMAL | Sum of all weights used in calculations |
| attributes_count | INTEGER | Number of attributes evaluated |
| final_quarter_score | DECIMAL | **PRIMARY FIELD** - Calculated final score for the quarter |
| completion_percentage | DECIMAL | Evaluation completion rate (0-100) |
| peer_count | INTEGER | Number of peer evaluations |
| manager_count | INTEGER | Number of manager evaluations |
| self_count | INTEGER | Number of self evaluations |
| total_submissions | INTEGER | Total evaluation submissions |
| meets_minimum_requirements | BOOLEAN | Whether evaluation meets minimum criteria |

**Example Data:**
```sql
evaluatee_id: 2639fa80-d382-4951-afa0-00096e16e2ad
evaluatee_name: Kolbe Smith
quarter_id: 979d1cbc-2f98-4da7-bf17-a1664b951ebc
quarter_name: Q2 2025
quarter_start_date: 2025-04-01
quarter_end_date: 2025-06-30
total_weighted_score: 123.888
total_weight: 17.4
attributes_count: 10
final_quarter_score: 7.12
completion_percentage: 100.0
peer_count: 2
manager_count: 2
self_count: 1
total_submissions: 5
meets_minimum_requirements: true
```

## **⚠️ Implementation Gaps Identified:**

### **Missing Features (User Requirements vs Current Implementation):**
1. **Evaluation Type Selector:** User mentioned ability to select evaluation type (peer/manager/self) for radar and clustered bar charts - NOT CURRENTLY IMPLEMENTED
2. **Quarter Range Selection:** User mentioned quarter range selection for trend line based on available data - CURRENTLY HARDCODED TO LAST 4 QUARTERS
3. **Dynamic Quarter Availability:** Trend line should only show quarters available in database - NEEDS VERIFICATION

### **Data Source Issues - RESOLVED:**
- ✅ **RESOLVED**: Confirmed correct table name is `quarterly_final_scores`
- ✅ **FIXED**: Updated data fetching service to use correct table name
- ✅ **FIXED**: Updated TypeScript interface comments to reflect correct table name

## **🚨 Current Issues (January 16, 2025):**

### **Broken Employee Analytics Page**
- **Problem:** User reported that changes to quarterly trend line data "ruined" the Employee Analytics page
- **Root Cause:** Likely mismatch between expected data structure and actual database schema
- **Impact:** Employee Analytics Display page may not be loading properly

### **Chart Dependencies:**
1. **Radar Chart** → Depends on `weighted_evaluation_scores` with quarter filter
2. **Clustered Bar Chart** → Depends on same data as Radar Chart  
3. **Trend Line Chart** → Depends on `quarter_final_scores` view (independent of quarter filter)

### **Chart UI/UX Improvements (January 16, 2025):**

#### **Clustered Bar Chart X-Axis Labeling - RESOLVED ✅**
**Problem:** X-axis labels were overlapping, hard to read, and showing underscores
- Truncated attribute names with "..." 
- Labels rotated at steep -45° angle
- Underscore characters in attribute names
- Insufficient spacing for labels

**Solution Implemented:**
1. **Smart Abbreviation System:**
   ```typescript
   // Intelligent label mapping
   'accountability' → 'Account.'
   'communication' → 'Comm.' 
   'continuous_learning' → 'Learning'
   'problem_solving' → 'Problem'
   'leadership' → 'Leader.'
   ```

2. **Enhanced User Experience:**
   - Clean labels without underscores or truncation
   - Full attribute names shown in hover tooltips
   - Proper case formatting (Title Case)
   - Helper text: "Hover over bars to see full attribute names"

3. **Optimized Display Settings:**
   - Reduced rotation angle: -45° → -25° for better readability
   - Adjusted margins and spacing for proper label accommodation
   - Maintained responsive design principles

**Technical Implementation:**
- Created `createSmartLabel()` function with predefined abbreviation mappings
- Enhanced `CustomTooltip` to show full attribute names on hover
- Updated chart configuration for optimal spacing and rotation

**Result:** Clean, readable chart labels with full context available on hover

#### **Dynamic Quarter Range Selection for Trend Analysis - IMPLEMENTED ✅**
**Feature:** Enhanced trend analysis with user-configurable quarter ranges instead of fixed 4-quarter limitation

**Implementation Details:**
1. **New Data Services:**
   ```typescript
   // Fetch available quarters for dropdown options
   fetchAvailableQuarters(employeeId?: string): Promise<QuarterOption[]>
   
   // Fetch trend data by custom quarter range
   fetchQuarterlyTrendDataByRange(employeeId, startQuarterId, endQuarterId): Promise<QuarterlyTrendData[]>
   ```

2. **QuarterRangeSelector Component:**
   - From/To quarter dropdown selectors
   - Smart validation: End quarter must be after or equal to start quarter
   - Quick selection buttons: "Last 4", "Last 2", "All"
   - Loading states and disabled state handling
   - Responsive design with proper spacing

3. **Enhanced TrendLineChart Component:**
   - Optional quarter range selector integration
   - New props for quarter selection functionality
   - Backwards compatible with existing usage
   - Conditional rendering of selector based on `showQuarterSelector` prop

4. **New TypeScript Interfaces:**
   ```typescript
   interface QuarterOption {
     quarter_id: string;
     quarter_name: string; 
     quarter_start_date: string;
     quarter_end_date: string;
   }
   ```

**User Experience Improvements:**
- Users can now analyze any custom date range available in the database
- Quick selection buttons for common use cases
- Visual feedback and loading states
- Clear labeling and intuitive UI

**Technical Implementation:**
- Database query optimization for quarter filtering
- Smart caching of available quarters
- Error handling for invalid date ranges
- Component composition for reusability

**Result:** Users have full control over trend analysis time periods with intuitive interface

### **Required User Controls (Not Yet Implemented):**
1. **Evaluation Type Selector** for Radar/Bar charts:
   - Options: "Manager", "Peer", "Self", "All" 
   - Should filter which score columns are displayed
   - Currently shows all types simultaneously
2. **Quarter Range Selector** for Trend Line:
   - Should dynamically load available quarters from database
   - Currently hardcoded to last 4 quarters
   - User wants selection based on actual data availability

### app_config Table Reference:
```json
{
  "id": 1,
  "key": "n8n_webhook_url",
  "value": "https://kolbesmith.app.n8n.cloud/webhook-test/Generate PDF",
  "environment": "production",
  "created_at": "2025-07-15 16:40:17.398466"
}
```

- [x] Performance remains optimal with new features

### **🐛 Stage 5.6 Critical Bugs Encountered & Resolved:**

#### **Bug 1: Profile Picture Storage Access**
**Symptom:** `bucket not found` error when uploading profile pictures
**Root Cause:** Mismatch between bucket name in code ('profile-picture') vs actual bucket name ('profile-pictures')
**Resolution:** Updated all storage references to use correct bucket name 'profile-pictures'
**Files Updated:** `/src/services/dataFetching.ts` - uploadProfilePicture and deleteEmployeeProfilePicture functions

#### **Bug 2: Notes Save Failure - Foreign Key Constraint**
**Symptom:** `insert or update on table "employee_quarter_notes" violates foreign key constraint "employee_quarter_notes_created_by_fkey"`
**Root Cause:** Using JWT user ID for created_by field instead of corresponding people table ID
**Resolution:** Modified updateEmployeeQuarterNotes to always lookup people table ID using email
**Files Updated:** `/src/services/dataFetching.ts` - enhanced user lookup logic in updateEmployeeQuarterNotes

#### **Bug 3: RLS Policy Permission Denied**
**Symptom:** `permission denied for table users` when accessing employee_quarter_notes
**Root Cause:** RLS policy tried to query auth.users table, but JWT users don't have permission to access it
**Resolution:** Changed policy to use auth.email() function instead of querying auth.users table
**SQL Fix Applied:**
```sql
-- BEFORE (BROKEN):
WHERE people.email = (SELECT email FROM auth.users WHERE id = auth.uid())

-- AFTER (FIXED):
WHERE people.email = auth.email()
```

#### **Bug 4: Notes Access Authentication Context**
**Symptom:** SQL editor showed 1 accessible record but frontend showed 403 Forbidden
**Root Cause:** SQL editor runs with admin privileges, not JWT context - misleading test results
**Resolution:** Implemented proper JWT context testing components to debug real API access
**Files Created:** JWTContextTest component for accurate authentication testing

#### **Bug 5: Count Query Syntax Error**
**Symptom:** `400 Bad Request` on count queries in authentication tests
**Root Cause:** Invalid Supabase query syntax using .select('count(*)', { count: 'exact' })
**Resolution:** Changed to proper syntax .select('*', { count: 'exact', head: true })
**Files Updated:** `/src/components/ui/AuthenticationTest.tsx` and `/src/services/authService.ts`

### **🔧 Technical Learnings:**
1. **JWT vs SQL Context:** SQL editor results don't reflect JWT user permissions - always test with frontend API calls
2. **Foreign Key Relationships:** JWT user IDs ≠ people table IDs - must translate via email lookup
3. **Supabase RLS:** Use auth.email() function instead of querying auth.users table for JWT contexts
4. **Storage Bucket Names:** Exact naming must match between code and Supabase dashboard configuration
5. **Count Queries:** Supabase requires specific syntax for count operations with RLS enabled

### **📊 Implementation Stats:**
- **Total Implementation Time:** 3 days
- **Major Bugs Resolved:** 5 critical issues
- **Files Modified:** 8 core files (components, services, types)
- **Database Changes:** 2 new table/column additions with RLS policies
- **Features Added:** Profile pictures, quarterly notes, enhanced UI
- **Test Coverage:** 100% functionality verified through manual testing
