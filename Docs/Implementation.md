## Project Overview

A-Player Evaluations is a data visualization dashboard for displaying quarterly employee evaluation data stored in Supabase. The dashboard provides managers with comprehensive views of 360-degree feedback through a 3-page interface: Login, Employee Selection, and Employee Analytics Display.

**Key Architecture Note:** ALL analytics and chart functionality is contained within the **Employee Analytics Display page**. This page opens when an employee is selected from the Employee Selection page and contains all data visualization, charts, AI analysis, and reporting features.

The system visualizes weighted evaluation scores calculated from Manager (55%), Peer (35%), and Self (10%) assessments across 10 standardized performance attributes. AI-powered analysis is performed externally via n8n workflows, with results displayed through integrated PDF viewers and download capabilities.
