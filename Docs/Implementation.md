## üèÜ **LATEST MAJOR ACHIEVEMENTS (January 25-31, 2025)**

### ‚úÖ React-PDF Report Renderer Migration (February 1, 2025) ‚Äî Stages 1‚Äì6 Completed
- Implemented new Culture Base‚Äìstyled PDF system using `@react-pdf/renderer` behind a feature flag, keeping legacy `jsPDF` generator intact for safe rollout
- Centralized theme system in `src/lib/theme.ts` (COLORS, TYPOGRAPHY, LAYOUT, helpers, feature flags, font weight utility)
- Built PDF primitives: `ScoreCard`, `ValueBar` (rounded bars, brand backgrounds), `PageWrapper` (footer, width fix)
- Created page components: `CoverPage`, `SummaryPage`, `StrengthsPage`, `DescriptiveReviewPage`
- Composed `ReportDocument` to orchestrate pages and pagination
- Added React builder `generateEmployeeReportReact()` with blob download and robust error handling
- Feature flag integration in `GeneratePDFButton.tsx` with runtime flags via localStorage + URL param; `window.devTools` helpers
- Downgraded to React 18 to resolve `@react-pdf/renderer` compatibility issues
- Data correctness: SummaryPage now sources attribute scores from `coreGroupBreakdown` (same as Employee Analytics) with defensive access
- Visual polish: standardized spacing, thicker rounded bars, compact layout, section backgrounds, branded teal gradient for core groups

Pending (Stage 7 ‚Äì QA rollout):
- Formal QA, flag default evaluation and staged rollout
- Descriptive review logic rules and logo asset placement
- Final spacing/typography tweaks based on stakeholder review

### ‚úÖ Descriptive Review via AI (Edge Function) ‚Äî Implemented
- Added Supabase Edge Function `ai-descriptive-review` design to securely generate group narratives
- Client builds compact payload (employeeName + per-group attributes {score, grade})
- Server calls AI provider with secrets stored in function env; returns `{ competence|character|curiosity: { gradeLine, paragraph } }`
- Integrated into `reactPdfBuilder.ts` to fetch AI review before PDF creation and pass to `ReportDocument`
- `DescriptiveReviewPage.tsx` prefers AI output; falls back to local `profileDescriptions.ts` when unavailable
- Maintains layout spec (teal headers, grade line, justified paragraph, 15px spacing, no group splits)

#### ‚ÑπÔ∏è Update (Aug 8, 2025)
- Dev live preview now invokes the AI function and passes `aiReview` into `ReportDocument` (see `src/pages/react-pdf/DevPdfPreview.tsx`)
- Supabase Edge Function updated with robust CORS handling (OPTIONS + Access-Control-Allow-* headers) to enable browser calls from `http://localhost:3005`
- Verified end-to-end: OPTIONS preflight returns 200 with ACAO, and Descriptive Review page renders AI content in preview

### üöÄ Coaching Report (AI) ‚Äî v2 Implemented per workflow

Status (Aug 11, 2025):
- v2 implemented and deployed. Edge Function prompts hardened, client orchestration stabilized, and PDF rendering refined.

What‚Äôs implemented (aligns to workflow.mdc):
1) Data Preprocessing (client)
   - Attribute name normalization; gap metrics (self vs others, mgr vs peer)
   - Multi-select aggregates (top values + counts)
   - Deterministic question intent tagging via `src/constants/questionTags.ts`

2) Prompt Strategy (server)
   - Sectioned calls: `strengths_dev`, `gaps_incidents`, `questions` with strict JSON schemas
   - Evidence rules: short quotes (‚â§140), rater labels, attributes, SMART interventions
   - Output rules: ‚Äúno JSON inside strings‚Äù; arrays of objects only; omit items without evidence
   - Provider fallback (Anthropic‚áÑOpenAI) and reduced tokens to mitigate 429 limits

3) Coverage & Logic
   - Perception gaps (threshold |self_vs_others| ‚â• 1.5) with numeric diffs + quotes
   - Critical incidents (score ‚â§ 7) formatted as Situation/Behavior/Impact/Recommendation; allow 0 when no evidence
   - Equal rater weighting; no recency bias for current quarter

4) PDF Formatting
   - `CoachingReportPage.tsx`: clean bullets with evidence lines; incidents render as SBIR bullets
   - Increased vertical spacing for readability; unique keys to silence React warnings
   - Summary page includes Core Group Definitions prior to per-attribute totals

Acceptance Criteria (v2)
- Grounded in real quotes; numeric gaps included; ‚â•3 strengths & ‚â•3 development areas; SMART interventions; no raw JSON ‚Äî Met in current previews.

Operational notes
- Env: `a-player-dashboard/.env` must define `VITE_SUPABASE_URL` and `VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`
- Secrets: Project Edge Function secrets must include a valid `OPENAI_API_KEY` (and optional `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`)
- Deploy: `supabase functions deploy ai-coaching-report` and `ai-descriptive-review` with the correct `--project-ref`

Tasks
- [x] Client preprocessing (responses, gaps, tagging, aggregates)
- [x] Sectioned Edge Function prompts + output rules
- [x] Provider fallback + token tuning (429 resilience)
- [x] Header auth on function calls (apikey + Authorization)
- [x] PDF rendering fixes (incidents, spacing, keys)
- [x] Core Group Definitions added to summary page
- [ ] Broaden `questionTags.ts` coverage as new question_ids appear (ongoing)
- [ ] Formal QA on at least 2 real employees; prompt polish if needed

#### üß™ Dev Live Preview with HMR (Added)
- Added dev-only React-PDF live preview route: `/dev/pdf-preview`
- Renders `ReportDocument` inside `@react-pdf/renderer` `PDFViewer` for hot reload during development
- Accepts query params: `?employeeId=<uuid>&quarterId=<uuid>&quarterName=<name>` and also reads NavigationContext state when present
- Top toolbar includes:
  - Inputs for Employee ID and Quarter ID
  - Refresh button to refetch data
  - ‚ÄúOpen in New Tab‚Äù button using `BlobProvider` for a blob URL
- Guarded with `import.meta.env.DEV`; not included in production builds

Usage (dev):
1) `npm run dev`
2) Authenticate
3) Navigate to `/dev/pdf-preview?employeeId=<uuid>&quarterId=<uuid>`
4) Edit React-PDF components; Vite HMR reloads the embedded viewer automatically

## Project Overview

A-Player Evaluations is a data visualization dashboard for displaying quarterly employee evaluation data stored in Supabase. The dashboard provides managers with comprehensive views of 360-degree feedback through a 3-page interface: Login, Employee Selection, and Employee Analytics Display.

**Key Architecture Note:** ALL analytics and chart functionality is contained within the **Employee Analytics Display page**. This page opens when an employee is selected from the Employee Selection page and contains all data visualization, charts, AI analysis, and reporting features.

The system visualizes weighted evaluation scores calculated from Manager (55%), Peer (35%), and Self (10%) assessments across 10 standardized performance attributes. AI-powered analysis is performed externally via n8n workflows, with results displayed through integrated PDF viewers and download capabilities.

### üÜï **Data Source Mapping for Charts (Updated January 16, 2025):**

## **Chart Data Sources - Current Implementation**

### **Radar Chart & Clustered Bar Chart**
- **Data Source:** `weighted_evaluation_scores` table
- **Fetching Function:** `fetchEvaluationScores(employeeId, quarterId)`
- **Key Columns:**
  - `manager_score` - Manager evaluation scores (1-10)
  - `peer_score` - Peer evaluation scores (1-10) 
  - `self_score` - Self evaluation scores (1-10)
  - `weighted_final_score` - Calculated weighted final score
- **Filtering:** Quarter-specific (user selects quarter in header)
- **User Controls:** Quarter selector dropdown (affects both charts simultaneously)
- **Data Relationship:** Both charts use identical data source with same quarter filter

### **Trend Line Chart** 
- **Data Source:** `quarter_final_scores` database view
- **Fetching Function:** `fetchQuarterlyTrendData(employeeId, quarterCount)`
- **Key Column:** `final_quarter_score` - Pre-aggregated quarterly performance score
- **Current Behavior:** Fetches last 4 quarters automatically from view
- **Data Relationship:** Independent of other charts' quarter selection

## **‚ö†Ô∏è Implementation Gaps Identified:**

### **Missing Features (User Requirements vs Current Implementation):**
1. **Evaluation Type Selector:** User mentioned ability to select evaluation type (peer/manager/self) for radar and clustered bar charts - NOT CURRENTLY IMPLEMENTED
2. **Quarter Range Selection:** User mentioned quarter range selection for trend line based on available data - CURRENTLY HARDCODED TO LAST 4 QUARTERS
3. **Dynamic Quarter Availability:** Trend line should only show quarters available in database - NEEDS VERIFICATION

### **Data Source Issues - RESOLVED:**
- ‚úÖ **RESOLVED**: Confirmed correct table name is `quarterly_final_scores`
- ‚úÖ **FIXED**: Updated data fetching service to use correct table name
- ‚úÖ **FIXED**: Updated TypeScript interface comments to reflect correct table name

## **üö® Current Issues (January 16, 2025):**

### **Broken Employee Analytics Page**
- **Problem:** User reported that changes to quarterly trend line data "ruined" the Employee Analytics page
- **Root Cause:** Likely mismatch between expected data structure and actual database schema
- **Impact:** Employee Analytics Display page may not be loading properly

### **Chart Dependencies:**
1. **Radar Chart** ‚Üí Depends on `weighted_evaluation_scores` with quarter filter
2. **Clustered Bar Chart** ‚Üí Depends on same data as Radar Chart  
3. **Trend Line Chart** ‚Üí Depends on `quarter_final_scores` view (independent of quarter filter)

### **Chart UI/UX Improvements (January 16, 2025):**

#### **Clustered Bar Chart X-Axis Labeling - RESOLVED ‚úÖ**
**Problem:** X-axis labels were overlapping, hard to read, and showing underscores
- Truncated attribute names with "..." 
- Labels rotated at steep -45¬∞ angle
- Underscore characters in attribute names
- Insufficient spacing for labels

**Solution Implemented:**
1. **Smart Abbreviation System:**
   ```typescript
   // Intelligent label mapping
   'accountability' ‚Üí 'Account.'
   'communication' ‚Üí 'Comm.' 
   'continuous_learning' ‚Üí 'Learning'
   'problem_solving' ‚Üí 'Problem'
   'leadership' ‚Üí 'Leader.'
   ```

2. **Enhanced User Experience:**
   - Clean labels without underscores or truncation
   - Full attribute names shown in hover tooltips
   - Proper case formatting (Title Case)
   - Helper text: "Hover over bars to see full attribute names"

3. **Optimized Display Settings:**
   - Reduced rotation angle: -45¬∞ ‚Üí -25¬∞ for better readability
   - Adjusted margins and spacing for proper label accommodation
   - Maintained responsive design principles

**Technical Implementation:**
- Created `createSmartLabel()` function with predefined abbreviation mappings
- Enhanced `CustomTooltip` to show full attribute names on hover
- Updated chart configuration for optimal spacing and rotation

**Result:** Clean, readable chart labels with full context available on hover

#### **Dynamic Quarter Range Selection for Trend Analysis - IMPLEMENTED ‚úÖ**
**Feature:** Enhanced trend analysis with user-configurable quarter ranges instead of fixed 4-quarter limitation

**Implementation Details:**
1. **New Data Services:**
   ```typescript
   // Fetch available quarters for dropdown options
   fetchAvailableQuarters(employeeId?: string): Promise<QuarterOption[]>
   
   // Fetch trend data by custom quarter range
   fetchQuarterlyTrendDataByRange(employeeId, startQuarterId, endQuarterId): Promise<QuarterlyTrendData[]>
   ```

2. **QuarterRangeSelector Component:**
   - From/To quarter dropdown selectors
   - Smart validation: End quarter must be after or equal to start quarter
   - Quick selection buttons: "Last 4", "Last 2", "All"
   - Loading states and disabled state handling
   - Responsive design with proper spacing

3. **Enhanced TrendLineChart Component:**
   - Optional quarter range selector integration
   - New props for quarter selection functionality
   - Backwards compatible with existing usage
   - Conditional rendering of selector based on `showQuarterSelector` prop

4. **New TypeScript Interfaces:**
   ```typescript
   interface QuarterOption {
     quarter_id: string;
     quarter_name: string; 
     quarter_start_date: string;
     quarter_end_date: string;
   }
   ```

**User Experience Improvements:**
- Users can now analyze any custom date range available in the database
- Quick selection buttons for common use cases
- Visual feedback and loading states
- Clear labeling and intuitive UI

**Technical Implementation:**
- Database query optimization for quarter filtering
- Smart caching of available quarters
- Error handling for invalid date ranges
- Component composition for reusability

**Result:** Users have full control over trend analysis time periods with intuitive interface

### **Required User Controls (Not Yet Implemented):**
1. **Evaluation Type Selector** for Radar/Bar charts:
   - Options: "Manager", "Peer", "Self", "All" 
   - Should filter which score columns are displayed
   - Currently shows all types simultaneously
2. **Quarter Range Selector** for Trend Line:
   - Should dynamically load available quarters from database
   - Currently hardcoded to last 4 quarters
   - User wants selection based on actual data availability

### app_config Table Reference:
```json
{
  "id": 1,
  "key": "n8n_webhook_url",
  "value": "https://kolbesmith.app.n8n.cloud/webhook-test/Generate PDF",
  "environment": "production",
  "created_at": "2025-07-15 16:40:17.398466"
}
```

### **üêõ Stage 5.6 Critical Bugs Encountered & Resolved:**

#### **Bug 1: Profile Picture Storage Access**
**Symptom:** `bucket not found` error when uploading profile pictures
**Root Cause:** Mismatch between bucket name in code ('profile-picture') vs actual bucket name ('profile-pictures')
**Resolution:** Updated all storage references to use correct bucket name 'profile-pictures'
**Files Updated:** `/src/services/dataFetching.ts` - uploadProfilePicture and deleteEmployeeProfilePicture functions

#### **Bug 2: Notes Save Failure - Foreign Key Constraint**
**Symptom:** `insert or update on table "employee_quarter_notes" violates foreign key constraint "employee_quarter_notes_created_by_fkey"`
**Root Cause:** Using JWT user ID for created_by field instead of corresponding people table ID
**Resolution:** Modified updateEmployeeQuarterNotes to always lookup people table ID using email
**Files Updated:** `/src/services/dataFetching.ts` - enhanced user lookup logic in updateEmployeeQuarterNotes

#### **Bug 3: RLS Policy Permission Denied**
**Symptom:** `permission denied for table users` when accessing employee_quarter_notes
**Root Cause:** RLS policy tried to query auth.users table, but JWT users don't have permission to access it
**Resolution:** Changed policy to use auth.email() function instead of querying auth.users table
**SQL Fix Applied:**
```sql
-- BEFORE (BROKEN):
WHERE people.email = (SELECT email FROM auth.users WHERE id = auth.uid())

-- AFTER (FIXED):
WHERE people.email = auth.email()
```

#### **Bug 4: Notes Access Authentication Context**
**Symptom:** SQL editor showed 1 accessible record but frontend showed 403 Forbidden
**Root Cause:** SQL editor runs with admin privileges, not JWT context - misleading test results
**Resolution:** Implemented proper JWT context testing components to debug real API access
**Files Created:** JWTContextTest component for accurate authentication testing

#### **Bug 5: Count Query Syntax Error**
**Symptom:** `400 Bad Request` on count queries in authentication tests
**Root Cause:** Invalid Supabase query syntax using .select('count(*)', { count: 'exact' })
**Resolution:** Changed to proper syntax .select('*', { count: 'exact', head: true })
**Files Updated:** `/src/components/ui/AuthenticationTest.tsx` and `/src/services/authService.ts`

### **üîß Technical Learnings:**
1. **JWT vs SQL Context:** SQL editor results don't reflect JWT user permissions - always test with frontend API calls
2. **Foreign Key Relationships:** JWT user IDs ‚â† people table IDs - must translate via email lookup
3. **Supabase RLS:** Use auth.email() function instead of querying auth.users table for JWT contexts
4. **Storage Bucket Names:** Exact naming must match between code and Supabase dashboard configuration
5. **Count Queries:** Supabase requires specific syntax for count operations with RLS enabled

### **üìä Implementation Stats:**
- **Total Implementation Time:** 3 days
- **Major Bugs Resolved:** 5 critical issues
- **Files Modified:** 8 core files (components, services, types)
- **Database Changes:** 2 new table/column additions with RLS policies
- **Features Added:** Profile pictures, quarterly notes, enhanced UI
